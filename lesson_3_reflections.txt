When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository rather than 
keeping all my work local in instances where I 
work on more than one computer which means it 
wouldn't be convenient to carry all of them around.  
Also, I would use a remote repository when it isn't 
convenient to take my computer with me, say, on a 
vacation.  Finally, I would want to use a local 
repository when I am working with someone else in 
a different location, where again, they don't have 
access to what may be on my computer.
